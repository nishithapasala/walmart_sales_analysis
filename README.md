# Walmart_sales_analysis
## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL (PostgreSQL) for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. This project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

# Project Steps
## Set Up the Environment

Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (PostgreSQL)

Set up a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

Ensure Python and PostgreSQL are installed and configured properly.

## Download Walmart Sales Data

Data Source: Use publicly available datasets from online sources (e.g., government portals, open data repositories, or direct file downloads from websites).

Store the data in a data/ folder for easy access and reference.

## Install Required Libraries and Load Data

Install necessary Python libraries.

Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.


## Explore the Data

Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.

## Data Cleaning

Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.

Handle Missing Values: Drop or fill missing values based on data relevance.

Fix Data Types: Convert dates to datetime and ensure numerical columns are properly formatted.

Currency Formatting: Standardize any currency values for better analysis.

Validation: Verify that the cleaned dataset is consistent.

## Feature Engineering

Create a Total Amount column

## Load Data into PostgreSQL

Table Creation: Define schema and load cleaned data iLoad Data into PostgreSQL

Set Up Connection: Use sqlalchemy and psycopg2 to connect to a PostgreSQL database.nto PostgreSQL.

## SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving

Key Business Questions:

Revenue Trends: How does revenue vary across branches and categories?

Best-Selling Products: Which products generate the most sales?

Sales Performance: How do sales fluctuate by time, city, and payment method?

Peak Sales Periods: When are the highest number of transactions made?

Profit Margins: Which branches and product categories are the most profitable?

Example SQL Query: (Finding the top 5 branches with the highest revenue decrease)

## Project Documentation and Publishing

Maintain Documentation:

Keep structured notes in Markdown or Jupyter Notebook.

Document SQL queries, assumptions, and findings.

Publish on GitHub:

Include:

README.md (Project Overview, Steps, and Findings)

Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable)

SQL query scripts

Cleaned data files (or steps to access them)

# Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to extracting valuable business insights from Walmart sales data. By integrating Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and data analysis techniques, we gain a deeper understanding of revenue trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance.
